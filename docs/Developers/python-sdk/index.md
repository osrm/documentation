The best way to get started is to get your hands dirty and start building.

In the following series of tutorials, you will learn how to build IP applications with Story SDK and the concepts we mentioned in the [Architecture Overview](doc:overview) of Story Protocol.

Along the way, you will learn how to:

* [Python SDK Setup](doc:python-sdk-setup)
* [Register PIL Terms](doc:register-pil-terms-python)
* [Attach License Terms to an IP Asset](doc:attach-license-terms-to-an-ip-asset-python)
* [Mint a License Token](doc:mint-a-license-token-python)
